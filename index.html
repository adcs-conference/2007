<p>
(2) Presenters: plan for 20--22 minutes of presentation, and then a
few minutes of questions.
The room is equipped with computer and projection, so best bet is to
bring your presentation on either CD or USB drive.

<p>
(3) There won't be a conference bag -- please bring your own.

<p>
(4) Even in Melbourne, it sometimes rains.

The symposium aims to cover all aspects of Document Computing -
issues ranging from the fundamentals of document architectures and
standards for markup, through storage, management, retrieval,
authentication and workflow, to active and virtual documents.
The symposium will emphasise both commercial and academic issues by
encouraging a variety of submissions.

<p><b>Personal Information Management: Stuff I've Seen and Beyond</b>

<p>Dr Susan Dumais<br>
Adaptive Systems and Interaction Group,<br>
Microsoft Research

<p><b>Abstract</b>:

Most information retrieval technologies are designed to facilitate
information discovery.
However, much knowledge work involves finding and re-using previously
seen information in the context of ongoing work activities.
We have developed a prototype system called Stuff I've Seen (SIS) to
support information re-use.
The system provides a unified index to information that a person has
seen, regardless of whether the information was seen as an email,
appointment, web page, document, hand-written note, etc.
Because the information has been seen before, rich contextual cues
and visualizations (including timelines and memory landmarks) can be
used to present search results.
The system also provides a test bed for exploring ideas about
meta-data driven retrieval and about techniques for supporting
information management in the richer context of ongoing work
activities.

<p><b>The speaker</b>:
Dr Susan Dumais is a Senior Researcher in the Adaptive Systems and
Interaction Group at Microsoft Research where she works on algorithms
and interfaces for improved information access and management.
Prior to joining Microsoft Research in 1997, she was at Bellcore and
Bell Labs for many years.
She has published widely in the areas of human-computer interaction
and information retrieval.
Her current research focuses on personal information retrieval, user
modeling, text categorization, and collaborative information
retrieval.
Previous research included well-known work on Latent Semantic
Indexing (a statistical method for concept-based retrieval),
combining search and navigation, individual differences, perceptual
learning and attention, and organizational impacts of new technology.

<p>
Susan is Past-Chair of ACM's SIGIR group, and serves on the NRC
Committee on Computing and Communications Research to Enable Better
Use of Information Technology in Digital Government, and the NRC
Board on Assessment of NIST Programs.
She is on the editorial boards of: ACM:Transactions on Information
Systems, ACM:Transactions on Human Computer Interaction, Human
Computer Interaction, Information Processing and Management,
Information Retrieval, Hypertext, Encyclopedia of Information
Retrieval, and Annual Review of Information Science and Technology,
and is actively involved on program committees for several
conferences.
She is an adjunct professor at the University of Washington in the
Information School, and has been a visiting faculty member at Stevens
Institute of Technology, New York University, and the University of
Chicago.

<h3>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Submissions (CLOSED)</font></font></h3>

Paper submissions must be sent to 
<a href="mailto:adcs2007@rmit.edu.au"> adcs2007@rmit.edu.au</a>
as a PDF
email file attachment (no exceptions) by the due date (no exceptions).
Submissions should comply with the <a href="paperguide.html">paper
guidelines</a>.

<p>All submissions must be original work, not previously published
elsewhere, and not currently submitted to any other conference or
journal.

<p><b>Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking
that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will
attend the symposium to present the work.</b> Note also that it is
insufficient for an author to register and pay for the symposium to
be regarded as fulfilling this obligation.

<h4>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Full papers</font></font></h4>

Full papers should describe new contributions or analyse research
issues.
Submissions should be at most 3000 words long; over-length submission
risk immediate rejection.
Refer to the <a href="paperguide.html">guidelines for
papers</a> for details of the required format.

<!--
<h4>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Posters, Short papers and Industry
Status Reports</font></font></h4>

To encourage participation by industry and to provide a place for
work of a more speculative nature, ADCS invites submissions for short
papers, up to a maximum of 1500 words.
A typical proposal might describe a leading-edge solution to a
practical problem in document management.
Short papers follow the same format as for full papers.

<p>Presentation of short papers will be via a poster session.
Accepted short papers will also be included in the symposium
proceedings.

<h4>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Demonstrations</font></font></h4>
If you would like to give a demonstration of your system, please submit
an abstract following the same format as for short papers.
Demonstrations should be self-contained, and only limited hardware support will be available at the venue.
-->

<p>A printed proceedings of the papers will be distributed to participants
at the symposium. Electronic copies of the papers will be made available
on the website after the symposium.
All submissions will be fully refereed by a blind refereeing process,
at their full published length, and will comply with DEST criteria for
fully-refereed conference papers (category F1).
