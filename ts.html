<h3>How to Evaluate Information Retrieval: Why is it Receiving
Attention Now?  </h3>

<p>My talk is a mash up of three parts.  PART ONE: I will introduce a
couple of novel information access services that we provide at
FreshEye, the Japanese Web portal run by NewsWatch, Inc.  NewsWatch was
founded by Toshiba in 1996, and was bought by Yahoo! JAPAN in 2006.
PART TWO: I will then discuss why information retrieval evaluation is
receiving a lot of attention in the research community now, and mention
some challenges, including the relevance data incompleteness issue, and
the possibility of evaluating online, nontraditional information access
services like the ones I have mentioned in PART ONE.  PART THREE: I
will describe the ongoing activities at NTCIR, which is an
international information retrieval evaluation effort for Asian
languages.  The latest tasks cover complex question answering,
cross-language information retrieval, opinion extraction and patent
mining/translation.  I will conclude the talk by urging you to submit a
paper to EVIA 2008, the Second International Workshop on Evaluating
Information Access, which will be held together with NTCIR-7 in Tokyo.
